    <h1>UN Datathon (RISING)</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Focus:</strong> Geospatial data + ML to support SDG-related
      investment decisions.

      Participated in a 72-hour long 2023
      <a href="https://www.data4sdgs.org/un-datathon-2023"
        >UN Datathon competition</a
      >. It is an annual event organised by the United Nations Committee of
      Experts on Big Data and Data Science for Official Statistics (UNCEBD).
      This represented an opportunity to contribute solutions to the challenges
      of the Sustainable Development Goals, which aligns with my passion about
      sustainability. Entered the competition as part of a team of 4.

        6 key transitions </a
      >, supported by 5 enablers, to accelerate progress towards achieving
      achieving the SDGs by 2030. We were tasked with
      <em>
        creating an innovative data solution which tackles local sustainable
        development challenges, and which leverages one or several of the six
        transitions </em
      >. The end product should be a solution that combines geospatial data to
      advance the SGDs.

      Our project was called Regional Investment Sustainably Increasing National
      GDP (RISING). It explored Kenya's GDP by county. It aims to help
      government and aid organizations maximize the impact of their investments
      by enabling them to understand which investments of the sustainable
      development pathways would also increase the GDP of a region. The analysis
      and mdoeling was done at the regional level to understand the different
      factors that are important for the different regions. This effort is in
      line with the theme of that edition of the competition, which is about
      localising actions and monitoring efforts.

      I was in charge of collecting and combining open source geospatial
      datasets with other data from various verifiable sources. The datasets
      encompass 4 different sustainable development pathways that we identified
      namely, <em>energy access</em>, <em>biodiversity loss</em>,
      <em>food systems</em> and <em>digital connectivity</em>. I also took the
      lead on the modelling side, where we built a machine learning model to
      estimate the GDP per capita from inputs including energy, economic and
      geospatial features. The solution was deployed as an application on
      Streamlit which users can interact with.

    <h2>What I did</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Collected and harmonized open geospatial datasets with other data
        sources.
      </li>
      <li>
        Led modeling to estimate the GDP per capita using economic + geospatial
        features.
      </li>
      <li>Helped deploy an interactive Streamlit app.</li>
    </ul>
