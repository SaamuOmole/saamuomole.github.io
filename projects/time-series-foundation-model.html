    <h1>Time Series Foundation Models (Write up in progress)</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Focus:</strong> Exposing DL foundation models in the wild, to
      model highly irregular time series data.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the prevalence of foundation models in Generative AI, time series
      analysis is an area which is now also experiencing an uptake in the
      application of foundation models. This project focus is on time series
      that is very irregular, unlike those characterised by the usual systematic
      patterns of seasonality, observable trend or a fixed-period cycle.
