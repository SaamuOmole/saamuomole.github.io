    <h1>Construction Open Data Project (Write up in progress)</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Focus:</strong> House price prediction across UK regions based on
      diverse socio-economic features.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a project to predict house prices in different parts of the UK
      using diverse interpretable features e.g., construction, geographical land
      use, unemployment, population, interest rates, etc. The UK regions where
      house prices were analysed include North East, North West, Yorkshire & the
      Humber, East Midlands, West Midlands, East, London, South East and South
      West.
    </p>
    <p>
      The various factors which affect house prices were investigated by
      analysis of the dataset and the machine learning model, which learns the
      underlying patterns between the different factors and the house price. The
      degree of influence of respective features on house price

      I collaborated with a few team mates to work on this exploratory project.
      I was involved in the project end to end, from data sourcing,
      pre-processing, feature engineering, modelling and deployment. A streamlit
      app was created to package the solution for deployment.
