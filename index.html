<h2>About</h2>
<p>
I’m a Data Scientist with experience in applied ML research and in building and deploying ML pipelines.
I thoroughly enjoy turning messy data into reliable systems to drive value.</p>

<p>While researching advanced materials and manufacturing technologies, I began applying machine learning
and signal processing techniques to extract insights from complex manufacturing systems and aid in timely decision-making.
I am passionate about engineering intelligent systems and deploying innovative AI solutions to solve real-world problems.</p>

<p><em>Skills: ML/DL, Foundation Models (Geospatial, Time Series), Computer Vision, Gen AI, LLMs </em></p>


<h2>Selected Projects</h2>

<div class="project">
  <strong>Regional Investment Sustainably Increasing National GDP (RISING)</strong><br />
  Participated in a 72-hour long <a href="https://www.data4sdgs.org/un-datathon-2023">UN Datathon competition</a> in 2023.
  It is an annual event organised by the United Nations Committee of Experts on Big Data and Data Science for Official
  Statistics (UNCEBD). This represented an opportunity to contribute solutions to the challenges of the Sustainable
  Development Goals, which aligns with my passion about sustainability. Entered the competition as part of a team of 4.<br />

  The UN introduced <a href="https://unstats.un.org/wiki/spaces/UNDatathon2023/pages/181274052/UN+Datathon+Theme">6 key transitions</a>,
  supported by 5 enablers, to accelerate progress towards achieving achieving the SDGs by 2030.
  We were tasked with <em>creating an innovative data solution which tackles local sustainable development challenges, and which
  leverages one or several of the six transitions</em>. The end product should be a solution that combines geospatial data to advance the SGDs.<br />
  
  Our chosen project explored Kenya's GDP by county. It aims to help government and aid organisations maximise the impact of their investments by enabling them to
  understand which investments of the sustainable development pathways would also increase the GDP of a region. The analysis and mdoelling was done at the regional
  level to understand the different factors that are important for the different regions. This effort is in line with the theme of that edition of the competiton, which is about
  localising actions and monitoring efforts. <br />
  
  I was in charge of collecting and combining open source geospatial datasets with other data from various verifiable sources. The datasets encompass 4 different
  sustainable development pathways that we identified namely, <em>energy access</em>, <em>biodiversity loss</em>, <em>food systems</em> and <em>digital connectivity</em>.
  I also took the lead on the modelling side, where we built a machine learning model to estimate the GDP per capita from inputs including energy, economic and geospatial features. 
  
  The solution was developed into a hosted streamlit application tool which users can interact with. The deployed app can be found <a href="https://hde-un-datathonapp.streamlit.app/">here</a>
